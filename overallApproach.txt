How to handle outliers in price usd + comp rate difference
	-> Include all different forms of pre-processing and let genetic algorithm choose?
	-> price_usd outliers: top off maximum at max gross_price_usd. Add a flag indicating price_usd < 5 since probably discount has been given

nDCG -> which formula to use? -> described on canvas

Model creation approach
	* Engineer all features
		- Dates to day and month
		- Summary per srch_id, prop_id
		- For all categorical/ordinal features compute weighted average of overall E[position], E[current class without current obs]
		- Estimated position of the hotel based on same hotel in same dest in prev and next search
		- Normalized features
			for price_usd, prop_starrating,  srch_id, prop_country_id, prop_location_scores, prop_review_score and prop_log_historical price
			by srch_id, prop_country_id, and month
			-> x / max(x) within each group
		- Competitor aggregation
			Sum over all comp_rates and comp_invs
			Average over comp_rate_percent_diff
		- Flag for prices below 5 dollar?
	
	* NA handling
		After feature engineering, impute all NAs with -1 (Owen Zhang)
			Other approaches?
	
	* Downsample negative values (not booked nor clicked)
		Downsample rate? 1:10?
		
	
	* Genetic algorithm
		Optimize used features and hyperparameters for XGBoost ranking models, take top n ( = 50?) best performing model
			Use subset of the data?
			Is one fold of data enough in this stage?
		Compare top n best models by means of cross validation (K = 30?) and compare performance statistically
			Keep test set apart for final performance estimation?
			Paired t-test?   (wilcoxon signed) rank test?
				Use binary tree for comparisons between models to save overhead
			Take top m ( = 25) best performing models
		Train top m models on total data set, predict test set using all models and average predictions
		Compare final model to a benchmark?
			Train on 80% of the train data and predict latter 20% for performance estimation
			What benchmark?
			Need to test difference statistically? 
		
	* Process report
		- Create per person or as a group?
		
	* report final model, not algorithm/parameters -> SHOW ACTUAL MODEL (plot tree)
